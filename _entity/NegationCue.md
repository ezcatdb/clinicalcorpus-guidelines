Negation words, such as "not", can be combined with event expressions.

~~~ ann
The patient did not undergo lung resect.
T1 Subject 4 11 patient
T2 Negation_cue 16 19 not
T3 Surgery 28 39 lung resect
T4 Anatomical_entity 28 32 lung
E1 Surgery:T3 has_subject:T1 occurs_at:T4 has_cue:T2
A1 Negated E1
~~~

However, even if the negation words can be identified as Negation_cue, such cues are not always connected with event expressions.

should be clicked with “Negation” for the Event attributes, although
they do not have corresponding negation cues.
