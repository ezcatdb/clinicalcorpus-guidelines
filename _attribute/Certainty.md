shortdef: "Certainty levels for Speculation"
order: 2
---

For those events with “speculation” attributes, Certainty levels can be determined according to the Speculation cues/Method cues. However, in some cases, it is difficult to determine the certainty levels, so that those events do not have any certainty levels.

Using PET-CT, we diagnosed liver metastases in the two patients.
T1 Method_cue 6 12 PET-CT
T3 Diagnosis 17 26 diagnosed
T4 Disease 27 43 liver metastases
T5 Subject 51 63 two patients
T6 N_sbjct 51 54 two
E1 Diagnosis:T3 disorder:T4 has_subject:T5 cue:T1
A1 Speculated E1
A2 Certainty E1 Confirmed
R1 Subject_Disorder Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4
R2 Subject_Attribute Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6

The following table indicates Speculation cues/Method cues and corresponding certainty levels
(Confirmed, Probable, Unlikely):
